## Changelog
- Add `generate.py`
- Modify print statements in `models\base_model.py`
- Modify num_test option in `options\test_options.py`
- Update `environement.yml`

The file `generate.py` allows to generate an arbitrary number of fake images (in contrast to `test.py`, it ignores realA and realB images). Certain print statements in `base_model.py` were replaced with tqdm.write(), such that the progress bar can be properly displayed. Furthermore, the default num_test argument was modified to allow for an arbitrary large number of generated images (upper bound is the size of the trainA or testA dataset). Finally, pip and tqdm were added to the Conda `environement.yml` file.

We provide our PyTorch implementation of unpaired image-to-image translation based on patchwise contrastive learning and adversarial learning.  No hand-crafted loss and inverse network is used. Compared to [CycleGAN](https://github.com/junyanz/CycleGAN), our model training is faster and less memory-intensive. In addition, our method can be extended to single image training, where each “domain” is only a *single* image.

### Pseudo code
```python
import torch
cross_entropy_loss = torch.nn.CrossEntropyLoss()

# Input: f_q (BxCxS) and sampled features from H(G_enc(x))
# Input: f_k (BxCxS) are sampled features from H(G_enc(G(x))
# Input: tau is the temperature used in PatchNCE loss.
# Output: PatchNCE loss
def PatchNCELoss(f_q, f_k, tau=0.07):
    # batch size, channel size, and number of sample locations
    B, C, S = f_q.shape

    # calculate v * v+: BxSx1
    l_pos = (f_k * f_q).sum(dim=1)[:, :, None]

    # calculate v * v-: BxSxS
    l_neg = torch.bmm(f_q.transpose(1, 2), f_k)

    # The diagonal entries are not negatives. Remove them.
    identity_matrix = torch.eye(S)[None, :, :]
    l_neg.masked_fill_(identity_matrix, -float('inf'))

    # calculate logits: (B)x(S)x(S+1)
    logits = torch.cat((l_pos, l_neg), dim=2) / tau

    # return PatchNCE loss
    predictions = logits.flatten(0, 1)
    targets = torch.zeros(B * S, dtype=torch.long)
    return cross_entropy_loss(predictions, targets)
```

bash ./datasets/download_cut_dataset.sh grumpifycat
```
The dataset is downloaded and unzipped at `./datasets/grumpifycat/`.

- To view training results and loss plots, run `python -m visdom.server` and click the URL http://localhost:8097.

- Train the CUT model:
```bash
python train.py --dataroot ./datasets/grumpifycat --name grumpycat_CUT --CUT_mode CUT
```
 Or train the FastCUT model
 ```bash
python train.py --dataroot ./datasets/grumpifycat --name grumpycat_FastCUT --CUT_mode FastCUT
```
The checkpoints will be stored at `./checkpoints/grumpycat_*/web`.

- Test the CUT model:
```bash
python test.py --dataroot ./datasets/grumpifycat --name grumpycat_CUT --CUT_mode CUT --phase train
```

The test results will be saved to a html file here: `./results/grumpifycat/latest_train/index.html`.

### CUT, FastCUT, and CycleGAN
<img src="imgs/horse2zebra_comparison.jpg" width="800px"/><br>

CUT is trained with the identity preservation loss and with `lambda_NCE=1`, while FastCUT is trained without the identity loss but with higher `lambda_NCE=10.0`. Compared to CycleGAN, CUT learns to perform more powerful distribution matching, while FastCUT is designed as a lighter (half the GPU memory, can fit a larger image), and faster (twice faster to train) alternative to CycleGAN. Please refer to the [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.15651) for more details.

In the above figure, we measure the percentage of pixels belonging to the horse/zebra bodies, using a pre-trained semantic segmentation model. We find a distribution mismatch between sizes of horses and zebras images -- zebras usually appear larger (36.8\% vs. 17.9\%). Our full method CUT has the flexibility to enlarge the horses, as a means of better matching of the training statistics than CycleGAN. FastCUT behaves more conservatively like CycleGAN.

### Training using our launcher scripts

Please see `experiments/grumpifycat_launcher.py` that generates the above command line arguments. The launcher scripts are useful for configuring rather complicated command-line arguments of training and testing.

Using the launcher, the command below generates the training command of CUT and FastCUT.
```bash
python -m experiments grumpifycat train 0   # CUT
python -m experiments grumpifycat train 1   # FastCUT
```

To test using the launcher,
```bash
python -m experiments grumpifycat test 0   # CUT
python -m experiments grumpifycat test 1   # FastCUT
```

Possible commands are run, run_test, launch, close, and so on. Please see `experiments/__main__.py` for all commands. Launcher is easy and quick to define and use. For example, the grumpifycat launcher is defined in a few lines:
```python
from .tmux_launcher import Options, TmuxLauncher


class Launcher(TmuxLauncher):
    def common_options(self):
        return [
            Options(    # Command 0
                dataroot="./datasets/grumpifycat",
                name="grumpifycat_CUT",
                CUT_mode="CUT"
            ),

            Options(    # Command 1
                dataroot="./datasets/grumpifycat",
                name="grumpifycat_FastCUT",
                CUT_mode="FastCUT",
            )
        ]

    def commands(self):
        return ["python train.py " + str(opt) for opt in self.common_options()]

    def test_commands(self):
        # Russian Blue -> Grumpy Cats dataset does not have test split.
        # Therefore, let's set the test split to be the "train" set.
        return ["python test.py " + str(opt.set(phase='train')) for opt in self.common_options()]

```



### Apply a pre-trained CUT model and evaluate FID

To run the pretrained models, run the following.

```bash

# Download and unzip the pretrained models. The weights should be located at
# checkpoints/horse2zebra_cut_pretrained/latest_net_G.pth, for example.
wget http://efrosgans.eecs.berkeley.edu/CUT/pretrained_models.tar
tar -xf pretrained_models.tar

# Generate outputs. The dataset paths might need to be adjusted.
# To do this, modify the lines of experiments/pretrained_launcher.py
# [id] corresponds to the respective commands defined in pretrained_launcher.py
# 0 - CUT on Cityscapes
# 1 - FastCUT on Cityscapes
# 2 - CUT on Horse2Zebra
# 3 - FastCUT on Horse2Zebra
# 4 - CUT on Cat2Dog
# 5 - FastCUT on Cat2Dog
python -m experiments pretrained run_test [id]

# Evaluate FID. To do this, first install pytorch-fid of https://github.com/mseitzer/pytorch-fid
# pip install pytorch-fid
# For example, to evaluate horse2zebra FID of CUT,
# python -m pytorch_fid ./datasets/horse2zebra/testB/ results/horse2zebra_cut_pretrained/test_latest/images/fake_B/
# To evaluate Cityscapes FID of FastCUT,
# python -m pytorch_fid ./datasets/cityscapes/valA/ ~/projects/contrastive-unpaired-translation/results/cityscapes_fastcut_pretrained/test_latest/images/fake_B/
# Note that a special dataset needs to be used for the Cityscapes model. Please read below. 
python -m pytorch_fid [path to real test images] [path to generated images]

```

Note: the Cityscapes pretrained model was trained and evaluated on a resized and JPEG-compressed version of the original Cityscapes dataset. To perform evaluation, please download [this](http://efrosgans.eecs.berkeley.edu/CUT/datasets/cityscapes_val_for_CUT.tar) validation set and perform evaluation. 


### SinCUT Single Image Unpaired Training

To train SinCUT (single-image translation, shown in Fig 9, 13 and 14 of the paper), you need to

1. set the `--model` option as `--model sincut`, which invokes the configuration and codes at `./models/sincut_model.py`, and
2. specify the dataset directory of one image in each domain, such as the example dataset included in this repo at `./datasets/single_image_monet_etretat/`. 

For example, to train a model for the [Etretat cliff (first image of Figure 13)](https://github.com/taesungp/contrastive-unpaired-translation/blob/master/imgs/singleimage.gif), please use the following command.

```bash
python train.py --model sincut --name singleimage_monet_etretat --dataroot ./datasets/single_image_monet_etretat
```

or by using the experiment launcher script,
```bash
python -m experiments singleimage run 0
```

For single-image translation, we adopt network architectural components of [StyleGAN2](https://github.com/NVlabs/stylegan2), as well as the pixel identity preservation loss used in [DTN](https://arxiv.org/abs/1611.02200) and [CycleGAN](https://github.com/junyanz/pytorch-CycleGAN-and-pix2pix/blob/master/models/cycle_gan_model.py#L160). In particular, we adopted the code of [rosinality](https://github.com/rosinality/stylegan2-pytorch), which exists at `models/stylegan_networks.py`.

The training takes several hours. To generate the final image using the checkpoint,

```bash
python test.py --model sincut --name singleimage_monet_etretat --dataroot ./datasets/single_image_monet_etretat
```

or simply

```bash
python -m experiments singleimage run_test 0
```

### [Datasets](./docs/datasets.md)
Download CUT/CycleGAN/pix2pix datasets. For example,

```bash
bash datasets/download_cut_datasets.sh horse2zebra
```

The Cat2Dog dataset is prepared from the AFHQ dataset. Please visit https://github.com/clovaai/stargan-v2 and download the AFHQ dataset by `bash download.sh afhq-dataset` of the github repo. Then reorganize directories as follows.
```bash
mkdir datasets/cat2dog
ln -s datasets/cat2dog/trainA [path_to_afhq]/train/cat
ln -s datasets/cat2dog/trainB [path_to_afhq]/train/dog
ln -s datasets/cat2dog/testA [path_to_afhq]/test/cat
ln -s datasets/cat2dog/testB [path_to_afhq]/test/dog
```

The Cityscapes dataset can be downloaded from https://cityscapes-dataset.com.
After that, use the script `./datasets/prepare_cityscapes_dataset.py` to prepare the dataset. 


#### Preprocessing of input images

The preprocessing of the input images, such as resizing or random cropping, is controlled by the option `--preprocess`, `--load_size`, and `--crop_size`. The usage follows the [CycleGAN/pix2pix](https://github.com/junyanz/pytorch-CycleGAN-and-pix2pix) repo. 

For example, the default setting `--preprocess resize_and_crop --load_size 286 --crop_size 256` resizes the input image to `286x286`, and then makes a random crop of size `256x256` as a way to perform data augmentation. There are other preprocessing options that can be specified, and they are specified in [base_dataset.py](https://github.com/taesungp/contrastive-unpaired-translation/blob/master/data/base_dataset.py#L82). Below are some example options. 

 - `--preprocess none`: does not perform any preprocessing. Note that the image size is still scaled to be a closest multiple of 4, because the convolutional generator cannot maintain the same image size otherwise. 
 - `--preprocess scale_width --load_size 768`: scales the width of the image to be of size 768.
 - `--preprocess scale_shortside_and_crop`: scales the image preserving aspect ratio so that the short side is `load_size`, and then performs random cropping of window size `crop_size`.

More preprocessing options can be added by modifying [`get_transform()`](https://github.com/taesungp/contrastive-unpaired-translation/blob/master/data/base_dataset.py#L82) of `base_dataset.py`.
